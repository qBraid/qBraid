## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `AnnealingResultData` class to `qbraid.runtime` module to represent annealing results. ([#768](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/768))
- Added `NECVectorAnnealerResultData` class to `qbraid.runtime.native` module to represent NEC vector annealer results. ([#768](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/768))
- Added `AnnealingExperimentMetadata` class to `qbraid.runtime.schemas` module to represent annealing experiment metadata. ([#768](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/768))
- Added `NECVectorAnnealerExperimentMetadata` class to `qbraid.runtime.schemas` module to represent NEC vector annealer experiment metadata. ([#768](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/768))
- Added mock data and methods to `test.resources` module to support testing of annealing and NEC vector annealing results. ([#768](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/768))
- Link to `examples` repo ([#778](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/778))

### Improved / Modified
- Updated the ExperimentType enum to change the value of ANNEALING from "quantum_annealing" to "annealing" to better reflect the general nature of experiments. ([#768](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/768))
- Updated `QbraidJob.result`  method to return `AnnealingResultData` or `NECVectorAnnealerResultData` instances for annealing and NEC vector annealer experiments, respectively. ([#768](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/768))
- Added a test case for the NEC Vector Annealer workflow in , including job submission and result retrieval. ([#768](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/768))
- Added unit tests for `AnnealingResultData`, `NECVectorAnnealerResultData`, and `AnnealingExperimentMetadata` classes. ([#768](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/768))
- PR compliance workflow that checks that `CHANGELOG.md` is updated with each PR, and if not, issues a reminder ([#772](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/772))
- Workflow to bump semantic version in `_version.py` ([#773](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/773))
- Changed `qbraid.runtime.NoiseModel` from an `Enum` to a `dataclass` and introduced `qbraid.runtime.NoiseModelSet` to manage multiple `NoiseModel` instances. An `Enum` was too restrictive since its values are fixed, so a more flexible structure was needed for loading noise model data from an API. Using a dataclass allows storing brief descriptions of noise models. `NoiseModelSet` ensures naming consistency and provides easy add, remove, and get operations for provider classes. ([#773](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/773))
- Make noise models optional in `DeviceData` schema ([#784](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/784))

```python
from qbraid.runtime.noise import NoiseModel, NoiseModelSet

ideal_model = NoiseModel("ideal", "Ideal noise model for simulations")
custom_model = NoiseModel("custom", "Custom noise model with specific parameters")

models = NoiseModelSet()
models.add(ideal_model)
models.add(custom_model)

retrieved_model = models.get("ideal")
print(f"Retrieved model: {retrieved_model.name} - {retrieved_model.description}")

models.add("ideal", "Updated ideal model", overwrite=True)

for name, model in models.items():
    print(f"{name}: {model.description}")

models.remove("custom")
```

- Moved `ExperimentType` enum into `qbraid.programs` ([#777](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/777))
- Renamed `qbraid.programs.circuits` to `qbraid.programs.gate_model` to match enum value ([#777](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/777))

### Deprecated

## [0.8.0] - 2024-09-23

### Added
- Added `qbraid.programs.typer` module containing custom types (`Qasm2StringType` and `Qasm3StringType`) that can be used instead of `str` for more accurate static typing, as well as instance variables (`Qasm2String` and `Qasm3String`) that can be used for `isinstance` checks against both OpenQASM 2 and 3 strings ([#745](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/745))
- Added `qbraid.runtime.enums.NoiseModel` enum for various noise model options that we may support on managed simulators in the future. This is not a supported feature just yet, so this enum is really just a placeholder. ([#745](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/745))
- Added `qbraid.runtime.azure` module with `AzureQuantumProvider` class to enable access to QPUs and simulators from IonQ, Quantinuum, and Rigetti, as well as the Microsoft resource estimator, using Azure credentials ([#723](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/723))
- Added `qbraid.programs.typer.QbraidMetaType` custom type instances e.g. `IonQDict`, `BaseQasmInstanceMeta` ([#752](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/752))
- Added `qbraid.runtime.Options` for more control over transpile, transform, and validation steps ([#752](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/752))
- Added `QbraidProvider.estimate_cost` method to enable getting the estimated number of qBraid credits it will cost to run a quantum job on a given device ([#754](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/754))

```python
from azure.quantum import Workspace

from qbraid.runtime.azure import AzureQuantumProvider

workspace = Workspace(...)

provider = AzureQuantumProvider(workspace)

device = provider.get_device("quantinuum.sim.h1-1sc")

circuit = """
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[3];
creg c0[3];
h q[0];
cx q[0], q[1];
cx q[1], q[2];
measure q[0] -> c0[0];
measure q[1] -> c0[1];
measure q[2] -> c0[2];
"""

job = device.run(circuit, shots=100)
job.wait_for_final_state()

result = job.result()
counts = result.measurement_counts()

print(counts) # {"000": 100}
```

### Improved / Modified
- Updated construction of `TargetProfile` in `QbraidProvider` to populate provider from API instead of defaulting to fixed value 'qBraid'. ([#744](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/744))
- Generalized native runtime submission flow to pave the way for support of new devices apart from the QIR simulator. Updated various routines including creating target profile and constructing payload so they are no longer specific to just the `qbraid_qir_simulator`, but can be adapted to new devices that come online fairly quickly. ([#745](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/745))
- Defined azure runtime program specs for devices based on provider / input data format ([#752](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/752))
- Moved IonQ dict "transform" from IonQ provider into transpiler conversions to be accessible from azure provider as well ([#752](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/752))
- Updated `qbraid.runtime.JobStatus` enum to support displaying custom status message if/when available ([#752](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/752))
- Updated the `qbraid.runtime.provider.QuantumProvider` methods `get_device` and `get_devices` to now cache the results, speeding up subsequent calls. Users still have ability to bypass this cache by using a `bypass_cache` argument. ([#755](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/755))

```python
import time

from qbraid.runtime.native import QbraidProvider

qbraid_provider = QbraidProvider()

start = time.time()
qbraid_devices = qbraid_provider.get_devices() # equivalent to bypass_cache=True
stop = time.time()

print(f"Original time: {stop - start:.6f} seconds")  # 0.837230 seconds

start_cache = time.time()
devices_cached = qbraid_provider.get_devices(bypass_cache=False)
stop_cache = time.time()

print(f"Cached time: {stop_cache - start_cache:.6f} seconds")  # 0.000117 seconds
```

**Unified Result class**

- Refactored runtime provider result handling: the `qbraid.runtime.QuantumJob.result` method now returns a unified `qbraid.runtime.Result` type, providing a consistent interface across all quantum device modalities. Specific result types (e.g., `GateModel`, `AHS`) are represented by the abstract `qbraid.runtime.ResultData` class, with each instance corresponding to a `qbraid.runtime.ExperimentType` (e.g., `GATE_MODEL`, `AHS`, etc.). Experiment-specific methods, such as retrieving measurement counts, are now accessed through the `Result.data` attribute, while general metadata (`job_id`, `device_id`, `success`) remains easily accessible through the `Result` class. This strikes a balance between the structured yet overly nested `qiskit.result.Result` and the disconnected result schemas in `braket.task_result`. See examples below for usage. ([#756](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/756))


```python
# Example 1: Gate Model Experiment via QbraidProvider

from qbraid.runtime import QbraidProvider, GateModelResultData

provider = QbraidProvider()
job = provider.get_device("qbraid_qir_simulator").run(circuit, shots=1000)
result = job.result()

# Unified access to metadata and experiment-specific data
print(f"device_id: {result.device_id}, job_id: {result.job_id}, success: {result.success}")
print(result.data.get_counts())  # e.g., {"00": 486, "11": 514}
```

```python
# Example 2: AHS Experiment via BraketProvider

from qbraid.runtime.aws import BraketProvider
from qbraid.runtime import AhsResultData, AhsShotResult

provider = BraketProvider()
job = provider.get("arn:aws:braket:us-east-1::device/qpu/quera/Aquila").run(ahs_program, shots=1000)
result = job.result()

# Unified access to metadata and experiment-specific data
print(f"device_id: {result.device_id}, job_id: {result.job_id}, success: {result.success}")
print(result.data.measurements)  # List of AhsShotResult instances
```
- Improved the `qbraid.transpiler.conversions.qasm2.qasm2_to_ionq` method by adding support for registers in quantum gate arguments. See example below - ([#771](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/771))

```python
from qbraid.transpiler.conversions.qasm2 import qasm2_to_ionq

qasm_str = """
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[3];
x q[0];
y q;
"""

print(qasm2_to_ionq(qasm_str))
```

outputs - 

```python
{'qubits': 3, 'circuit': [{'gate': 'x', 'target': 0}, 
                          {'gate': 'y', 'target': 0}, 
                          {'gate': 'y', 'target': 1}, 
                          {'gate': 'y', 'target': 2}]}
```

### Deprecated
- `result.measurement_counts()` method(s) from result objects retured by `qbraid.runtime.QuantumJob.result()`. Intead, for gate model jobs, measurement counts dictionary now accessible via `result.data.get_counts()`. ([#756](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/756))

### Removed
- Removed `qbraid.runtime.DeviceActionType` enum. Functionally replaced by `qbraid.runtime.ExperimentType`. ([#756](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/756))
- Removed `qbraid.runtime.QuantumJobResult`. Replaced by `qbraid.runtime.Result`. ([#756](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/756))
- Removed `qbraid.runtime.GateModelJobResult`. Replaced by `qbraid.runtime.GateModelResultData`. ([#756](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/756))

### Fixed
- Fixed `qbraid.transpiler.transpile` bug where the shortest path wasn't always being favored by the rustworkx pathfinding algorithm. Fixed by adding a bias parameter to both the `ConversionGraph` and `Conversion` classes that attributes as small weight to each conversion by default. ([#745](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pull/745))
